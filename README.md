## Install

- **Note: requires a node version >= 10 and yarn 1.10.1.**

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Run

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

Alternatively, you can run the renderer and main processes separately. This way, you can restart one process without waiting for the other. Run these two commands **simultaneously** in different console tabs:

```bash
$ yarn start-renderer-dev
$ yarn start-main-dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,

```bash
$ yarn package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ yarn package -- --[option]
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ yarn build
$ yarn test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:

```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package
```
